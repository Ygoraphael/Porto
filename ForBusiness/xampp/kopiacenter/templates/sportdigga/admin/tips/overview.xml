	<tip label="How To Use The Showcase Slider?">
		<![CDATA[
		The default slider images are located in /templates/sportdigga/images/slider/
                <br/><br/>
                If you want to use your own custom slider images, you need to know a few things:
                <br/><br/>
                1. The slides are always running as background images in the SHOWCASE position
                <br/><br/>
                2. In order to activate the SHOWCASE position, you need to use a module and assign it the module position "showcase-a" (or b,c,d,e,f if you need more).
                <br/><br/>
                3. If no showcase position is used, the slider won't show up.
                <br/><br/>
                4. The height of the showcase slider is calculated by the height of the slide images. So it is very recommended to use images in a series that all have the same height. The width for every image should be approx. 3000px to cover high screen resolutions.
                <br/><br/>
                5. You can create distinct slideshows for any page (= menu item). In order to do so, create the folder /media/sportdigga/ and /media/sportdigga/slider/
                <br/><br/>
                Inside the slider folder create a folder for each menu item, named by the menu item id number (can be determined in the menu manager of joomla).
                <br><br/>
                Inside the folders of each menu item that you created, paste your images using your FTP client (JPEG and/or PNG).
                <br/><br/>
                Then open the page with the menu item you uploaded the images for and instead of the default slider images, it'll show your custom ones.

        <tip label="How To Change Colors?">
            <![CDATA[
            Color options for this template are only available in the pro version.
            <br/><br/>
            Changing colors is simple: Go to the Colors tab of this template and choose the right colors as desired.
            <br/><br/>
            Keep in mind that we heavily use filters and lighten up some color codes in the module positions to keep smooth gradients, no matter what color has been selected.
            If you want dark color tones, then please user a much more darkened version of the color you want to use.
            <br/><br/>
            Best is you'll play around with the color options for each area of your website one-by-one, starting with links and then all the way down for the module positions you are using.
